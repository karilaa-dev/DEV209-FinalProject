# Styling Overview

This document provides an overview of the styling approach used in the Music Playlist Creator application.

## CSS Organization

The CSS styles are organized into the following directories:

-   `src/styles/index.css`: Contains global styles that apply to the entire application.
-   `src/styles/base/`: Contains base styles, such as resets and typography.
-   `src/styles/components/`: Contains styles for individual components.
-   `src/styles/pages/`: Contains styles for individual pages.

## Component-Specific Styling

Each component has its own CSS file in the `src/styles/components/` directory. The CSS file is named after the component (e.g., `src/styles/components/VideoItem.css` for the `VideoItem` component).

## Responsive Design Implementation

The application uses a responsive design approach to ensure that it looks good on different screen sizes. Media queries are used to adjust the layout and styling of the application based on the screen size.

## Theme Variables and Constants

The application does not use explicit theme variables or constants.
